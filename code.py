        ## Welcome to Grit Platform
        Grit Platform helps you manage and track your personal goals effectively. 
        Our hierarchical goal-setting approach allows you to align your daily tasks 
        with your long-term aspirations.

        ### How it works:
        1. **High-level Goal:** Set your overarching life objective.
        2. **Mid-level Goals:** Define long-term milestones.
        3. **Low-level Goals:** Plan daily tasks that contribute to your mid-level goals.

        Get started by navigating to the Goals section!
